# LEFT-ROTATION
This program rotates the elements of an array to the left by a given number of times. The `rotateLeft` function first figures out how many rotations are needed, then shifts the elements so that the first `d` items move to the end of the list. The `Main` method reads the array and the number of rotations from the user, calls the function, and prints the rotated array as the result.
