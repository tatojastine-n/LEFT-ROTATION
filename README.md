# LEFT-ROTATION
â€¢	This program performs a left rotation on an array by d positions. The main function reads input values for array size n, rotation amount d, and the array elements, then invokes the rotateLeft function to generate the rotated array, which is output to a file with space-separated values. The rotateLeft function optimizes d by modulo n, creates a new vector, and populates it by shifting elements using (i + d) % n indexing for efficient wrapping. Utility functions ltrim, rtrim, and split handle input string processing by trimming whitespace and tokenizing. The code is efficient and preserves the original array.
